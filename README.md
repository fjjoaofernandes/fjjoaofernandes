- Hi, I’m João Fernandes, a brazilian studying Information System at UFMS (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, in english)
I'm also a member of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the university - which makes me improve in calculus topics and programming as well -
and a member of the robotics team of the university, being that a key factor to improve my hardware and electrical circuits knowledge.

- I’m interested in techie things in general, but artificial intelligence (in robotics) and machine learning (in research and very cool projects)
both has my heart. I also would like to start learning a third language, being Italian my favorite aspirant.

- I’m currently learning Python and it's ML branches, such as Pytorch/numpy library, theoritical and practical concepts of database,
organizational behavior (seems kinda boring - and it is - but it's really important to not be limited to hard skills only) and software engineering
concepts (such as UML diagrams, object oriented programming and coding best practices).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that catch my attention and creating useful and readable repositories.
